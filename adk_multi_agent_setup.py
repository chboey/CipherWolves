# 2. Define the Agents and Their Relationship:
# We use Agent (or LlmAgent) to create our agents.
# Pay close attention to the instruction and description fields – the LLM relies heavily on these.

# Actual ADK imports would be something like:
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
# from google.adk.llms import LiteLlm # Assuming LiteLlm is a specific class for this integration
# from google.adk.tools import function_tool # Or how tools are decorated/defined

# For demonstration, if LiteLlm is not a direct ADK export but a pattern:
# We'll keep a simplified LiteLlm placeholder if its direct import is unknown,
# but ideally, you'd use ADK's mechanism for various model providers.
class LiteLlmModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        self.model_name = model_name
    def __str__(self):
        return f"LiteLLMProvider({self.model_name})"

# --- Agent Definitions ---
# Note: The 'model' parameter in LlmAgent would take the actual model instance or identifier
# recognized by ADK, which could be a string for Gemini models or an object for others.

greeting_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=LiteLlmModel(model_name="anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229"), # Example: Using the placeholder
    name="greeting_agent",
    instruction="You are the Greeting Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a friendly greeting to the user. "
                "Do not engage in any other conversation or tasks.",
    # Crucial for delegation: Clear description of capability
    description="Handles simple greetings and hellos.",
)

farewell_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=LiteLlmModel(model_name="anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229"), # Example: Using the placeholder
    name="farewell_agent",
    instruction="You are the Farewell Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a polite goodbye message. "
                "Do not perform any other actions.",
    # Crucial for delegation: Clear description of capability
    description="Handles simple farewells and goodbyes.",
)

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="weather_agent_v2",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp", # This is likely how a Gemini model would be specified
    description="You are the main Weather Agent, coordinating a team. "
                "- Your main task: Provide weather using the `get_weather` tool. Handle its 'status' response ('report' or 'error_message'). "
                "- Delegation Rules: "
                "  - If the user gives a simple greeting (like 'Hi', 'Hello'), delegate to `greeting_agent`. "
                "  - If the user gives a simple farewell (like 'Bye', 'See you'), delegate to `farewell_agent`. "
                "  - Handle weather requests yourself using `get_weather`. "
                "  - For other queries, state clearly if you cannot handle them.",
    tools=[get_weather], # Root agent uses the weather tool
    sub_agents=[greeting_agent, farewell_agent] # Defines the hierarchy
)

# To run this (conceptual):
# 1. Ensure ADK is installed and configured.
# 2. You would then use the ADK runtime (CLI or Web UI) to load and interact with 'root_agent'.
#    Interactions are typically managed within ADK Sessions.
#    Example (conceptual) using a Python API if available:
#
#    from google.adk.sessions import SessionManager # Hypothetical session manager
#
#    # Assume agents are registered or loaded by ADK's runtime
#    # session = SessionManager.create_session(agent_name="weather_agent_v2")
#    # response = session.send_message("Hi there!")
#    # print(response.text)
#    # response = session.send_message("What's the weather in London?")
#    # print(response.text)
#    # response = session.send_message("Bye!")
#    # print(response.text)
#
# 3. Or, using the ADK CLI (conceptual commands based on typical patterns):
#    $ adk agent load adk_multi_agent_setup.py
#    $ adk web # To launch the web UI and interact with 'weather_agent_v2'
#    $ adk chat weather_agent_v2
#    > Hi there!
#    (Agent Responds)
#    > What's the weather in London?
#    (Agent Responds)

print("\nADK Multi-Agent setup defined.")
print(f"Root agent: {root_agent.name}")
print(f"Sub-agents: {[sa.name for sa in root_agent.sub_agents]}")
print(f"Root agent tools: {[tool.__name__ for tool in root_agent.tools]}")

# Please refer to the official ADK documentation ([https://google.github.io/adk-docs/](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/))
# for the correct class names (e.g., LlmAgent, specific model wrappers like LiteLlm integration),
# tool definitions, session management, and exact CLI/API usage for running agents.
