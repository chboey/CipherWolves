    You are participating in the Round of the werewolf elimination game.
    
    CURRENT SITUATION:
    - Remaining Players: {', '.join(agent_names)}
    - Round: {round_number}
    
    ORIGINAL CONVERSATION:
    {conversation_text}
    
    {analysis_context}
    
    {history_context}
    
    VOTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    Based on all available information, vote to ELIMINATE one player other than yourself that you believe is the werewolf.
    You have been provided with:
    1. The original conversation between agents
    2. Questions asked by the HUMAN USER during the analysis phase and how each agent responded
    3. Previous voting history
    
    When you see your name, refer to yourself as I. Example: As I have said earlier.
    
    Analyze these aspects:
    1. Keyword usage patterns and consistency
    2. Response patterns and behavioral analysis
    3. Previous voting patterns and defensive behavior
    4. Overall suspicion level based on all interactions
    5. How agents responded to the HUMAN USER's analysis questions - were they evasive, defensive, or cooperative?
    
    VOTING OPTIONS:
    - Vote to ELIMINATE a specific agent that is not yourself.
    - ABSTAIN: If you don't have enough evidence (but be careful - abstaining helps the werewolf!)
    
    IMPORTANT GAME RULES:
    - If MAJORITY votes for the same agent ‚Üí That agent is ELIMINATED
    - If MAJORITY abstains ‚Üí No elimination this round
    - If there's a TIE ‚Üí No elimination this round
    - Game continues until werewolf is found or only 2 players remain
    
    Please provide your vote in this EXACT format:
    VOTE: [AGENT_NAME or ABSTAIN]
    REASONING: [Your detailed reasoning for the vote]
    CONFIDENCE: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
    SUSPICION_LEVEL: [How suspicious you are of your target on a scale 1-10]
    
    Example:
    VOTE: Agent_B
    REASONING: Agent_B's responses have been inconsistent and their keyword usage feels forced. They also gave evasive answers to the HUMAN USER's analysis questions, which is suspicious behavior.
    CONFIDENCE: HIGH
    SUSPICION_LEVEL: 8
